# Unity Tutorial: Object Pulling

The purpose of the tutorial is to change the initial commit codes which are constantly creating and destroying objects.
And use the concept of Object Pulling instead.

This is a hand-on tutorial based on [Unity Tutorial of the same name by Mike Geig](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/object-pooling).
